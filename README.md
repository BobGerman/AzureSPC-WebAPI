# AzureSPC-WebAPI

This repo contains a Web API demo in Azure. Each step is represented by a git branch, which contains a code snapshot at the end of a step. Here is the naming convention:

```
       |   | 
StepXX | a | -Description
       | b |
```

where:

 * XX - sequence number
 * (no letter) - there was no scaffolding in this step, only code changes
 * a - snapshot after applying scaffolding
 * b - snapshot after code changes

For example,

Step01a-CreateWebAPIProject: shows the project after creation with Visual Studio scaffolding

Step01b-CreateWebAPIProject: shows the project after modifying the code
